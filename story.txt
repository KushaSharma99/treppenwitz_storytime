A long time ago, in a mythical period known as the 90s, Schloss Rammstein arose in Berlin, and German dance-metal washed over the land.
There existed a hund named Eltz, who harrassed the town by racing his Porche down Berlin's hauptstrasse, wearing a pair of lederhose, and eating apfelkuchen.
Schloss in his BMW lined up alongside Eltz challenging him to a race, first to reach the Baeckerei wins.
